Using Machine Learning to Optimize pBAE Nanoparticles and Predict their Uptake for Gene Therapy Applications

In this project, data related to the properties of pBAE nanoparticles and their uptake in different cell lines was collected, and then used to develop various machine learning models to predict the uptake in these different cell lines. A multi-linear regression model, random forest model, gradient-boosted trees model and neural network were all created, trained, and tuned on this data set. Additionally, SHAP analysis was carried out at the end on the gradient-boosted trees model, to gain an understanding into the importance of each feature and improve the design process of these nanoparticles.
